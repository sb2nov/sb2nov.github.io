A theme compatible with [Jekyll-Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com). This theme is based on the [minimal](http://github.com/orderedlist/minimal) theme (for GitHub Pages), created by [Steve Smith](https://github.com/orderedlist).

Jekyll-Bootstrap is a blogging framework with built-in support for theming, analytics, comments, and post/page creation.

[See this theme in action.](http://sdb.github.com/)

## Usage

See the Jekyll-Bootstrap [tutorial](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/usage/index.html) for instructions on how to get your blog installed and published via [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).

When you're done with that, excute the following `rake` task to install and switch to the ghminimal theme.

    rake theme:install git="git://github.com/sdb/jb-theme-ghminimal"

Enjoy!
